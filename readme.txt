# complementarity

This project computes Drysdale's trade complementarity, bias and intensity indexes using trade data from the CEPII BACI database. 

## Usage

To compute the indexes, you first need to download the BACI dataset of your choice from the CEPII website: http://www.cepii.fr/CEPII/en/bdd_modele/bdd_modele_item.asp?id=37

Save the dataset in a subfolder /data/. 

The main code file is complementarity.R. You will need to check the file names in lines 9 and 27 to make sure they reflect the BACI version you have downloaded.
